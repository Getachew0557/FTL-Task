    "**Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a user and provides a health assessment based on their BMI value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background Context:**\n",
    "BMI is a measure used to determine whether a person has a healthy body weight for a person of their height. It is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in kilograms}}{\\text{height in meters}^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The BMI categories are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5\n",
    "* Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9\n",
    "* Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9\n",
    "* Obesity: BMI is 30 or greater\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prompt the user to input their weight in kilograms (float).\n",
    "* Prompt the user to input their height in meters (float).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculate BMI:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the formula provided, calculate the BMI. Store it in a variable named bmi.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Provide Health Assessment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using conditional statements (if, elif, and else), determine which BMI category the user falls into.\n",
    "Print out the user's BMI and the corresponding health assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure the user cannot enter a negative or zero value for height or weight. If they do, provide an error message and prompt them to enter the value again.\n"
